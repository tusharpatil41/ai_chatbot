## 📱 Project Overview

This Flutter application allows a user to play **Tic Tac Toe against an AI**.
The AI makes optimal decisions using the **Minimax algorithm**, making it
challenging and fun to play.

The project demonstrates:
- Game logic implementation
- Artificial Intelligence (Minimax)
- Flutter UI development
- Clean code structure

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 Single-player mode (Human vs AI)
- 🤖 Smart AI using Minimax algorithm
- 🔁 Restart game option
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI
- 🧠 Win, lose, and draw detection
- 📱 Works on Android (Flutter)

---

## 🧠 AI Logic (Minimax Algorithm)

The AI evaluates all possible game states and selects the **best possible move**
that maximizes its chance of winning while minimizing the player's chance.

### Algorithm Used:
- Minimax
- Recursive decision-making
- Game state evaluation (win / lose / draw)
